This app was a project that started with Leon Noel's #100Devs.

I enjoyed it so much that I decided to style it and change the way the pictures and videos appeared in the display area. 

After I was happy with the way the app was reacting, I decided to hide the API key.
This turned into quite the challenge as I had ever done this before. 

I had to load a few packages using nodejs and after a lot of trial and error I was able to make the app work in a way in which the API_KEY is hidden as far as I can tell. 

A couple of great video I had to reference to are... installing parcel and packages https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3EZ9dvjuHI and hiding API's https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17UVejOw3zA&t=304s.  

Make sure to check the package.json file to see the packages I installed (dependencies and devDependencies).  I then used Vercel.com to create the app, which you can check out here: https://nasa-two.vercel.app/  ... Hope you ENJOY the app!
